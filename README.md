# Hospital_Emergency_Room_Dashboard
I recently built a Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard in Power BI, providing a monthly view of key emergency room metrics. To enhance insights, we also developed a Consolidated View Dashboard with multiple data visualizations for better analysis and decision-making.
**Key Features & Techniques Used:**
  Data Cleaning & Transformation for accurate reporting
  Data Modeling to establish meaningful relationships
  Navigation Features for smooth interaction
**Visuals Used:**
   Stacked Bar Chart – To compare patient inflow trends
   Matrix & Table Views – For structured data representation
   KPI Cards – Quick summary of key performance indicators
   Line Graphs & Heatmaps – For trend analysis & peak hours

This project was a great learning experience in data visualization, storytelling, and Power BI functionalities.
